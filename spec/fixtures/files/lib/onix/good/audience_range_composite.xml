  <MainDescription>BRITISH ENGLISH, A TO ZED is the thoroughly updated,
    revised, and expanded third edition of Norman Schur’s highly acclaimed
    transatlantic dictionary for English speakers. First published as BRITISH SELFTAUGHT and then aENGLISH ENGLISH, this collection of Briticisms for
    Americans, and Americanisms for the British, is a scholarly yet witty lexicon,
    combining definitions with commentary on the most frequently used and some
    lesser known words and phrases. Highly readable, it’s a snip of a book, and one
    that sorts out – through comments in American – the “Queen’s English” –
    confounding as it may seem.</MainDescription>
  <ReviewQuote>Norman Schur is without doubt the outstanding authority on the
    similarities and differences between British and American English. BRITISH
    ENGLISH, A TO ZED attests not only to his expertise, but also to his undiminished
    powers to inform, amuse and entertain. – Laurence Urdang, Editor, VERBATIM,
    The Language Quarterly, Spring 1988 </ReviewQuote>
